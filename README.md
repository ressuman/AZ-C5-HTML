The appropriate use of heading tags to structure my content. I also created at least two levels of headings.
I also wrote at least two paragraphs of text in the body of my webpage and ensured that they are well-structured and informative.

I included comments in my HTML code to explain the purpose and structure of different sections of my document and used comments to describe my headings, paragraphs, and other significant elements.
