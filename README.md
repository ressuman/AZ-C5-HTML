The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding of HTML document structure, the head and body elements, headings, paragraphs, text formatting, and the use of comments in HTML.      
Ensure your HTML document includes the necessary structural elements.
Inside the head element,I included a <title> element with a descriptive title for my webpage. Also included a favicon and a few metadata for your document.

Inside the body element, I created the main content of my webpage which included,
The appropriate use of heading tags to structure my content. I also created at least two levels of headings.
I also wrote at least two paragraphs of text in the body of my webpage and ensured that they are well-structured and informative.
I applied text formatting to my content using HTML tags. For example, made some text bold, italic, underlined specific parts of my paragraphs and applied other formatting tags to my paragraphs.
I included comments in my HTML code to explain the purpose and structure of different sections of my document and used comments to describe my headings, paragraphs, and other significant elements.
Finally, I double-checked my HTML file for any errors or typos.
